 * 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View (Medium)
 * There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.
 * The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions.
 * Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.
 * Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.
 * Runtime 336 ms Beats 6.49%
 * Memory 53.7 MB Beats 95.96%
