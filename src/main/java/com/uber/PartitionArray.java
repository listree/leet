 * You are given an integer array nums of 2 * n integers. You need to partition nums into two arrays of length n to minimize
 * the absolute difference of the sums of the arrays. To partition nums, put each element of nums into one of the two arrays.
 *
 * Return the minimum possible absolute difference.
